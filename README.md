## 1. Introduction

This project illustrates a simple communication model between a teacher and multiple students using a microservices architecture. Each component of the system is implemented as an independent microservice and containerized using Docker.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how Docker can be used to coordinate and manage microservices effectively, showcasing the principles of containerization, isolation, and service orchestration.

## 2. Techincal Apsects

This section explains the most important technical aspects of the project.

### 1. Micorservices archiecture

**Microservices Architecture (MSA)** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a distinct business capability and communicates with others using lightweight protocols, typically HTTP or messaging systems.

---

### Key Characteristics (Fowler & Lewis, 2014):

- **Componentization via Services**  
  Each part of the system is a separate service, which can be deployed independently and developed in isolation.

- **Business-Oriented Organization**  
  Teams are organized around business capabilities rather than technical layers (e.g., “Order Management” instead of “Database Layer”).

- **Independent Deployment**  
  Each service can be deployed without affecting the others, enabling continuous delivery and rapid iterations.

- **Decentralized Data Management**  
  Each service manages its own database or data store, promoting autonomy and avoiding shared database bottlenecks.

- **Built for Failure**  
  Microservices embrace the reality of failure. They use patterns like circuit breakers and retries to build fault-tolerant systems.

- **Infrastructure Automation**  
  Continuous integration, automated testing, and deployment pipelines are essential to manage the complexity of microservices.
