## 1. Introduction

This project illustrates a simple communication model between a teacher and multiple students using a microservices architecture. Each component of the system is implemented as an independent microservice and containerized using Docker.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how Docker can be used to coordinate and manage microservices effectively, showcasing the principles of containerization, isolation, and service orchestration.

## 2. Techincal Apsects

This section explains the most important technical aspects of the project.

### 1. Micorservices archiecture

**Microservices Architecture (MSA)** is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service is responsible for a distinct business capability and communicates with others using lightweight protocols, typically HTTP or messaging systems.

---

### Key Characteristics (Fowler & Lewis, 2014):

- **Componentization via Services**  
  Each part of the system is a separate service, which can be deployed independently and developed in isolation.

- **Business-Oriented Organization**  
  Teams are organized around business capabilities rather than technical layers (e.g., “Order Management” instead of “Database Layer”).

- **Independent Deployment**  
  Each service can be deployed without affecting the others, enabling continuous delivery and rapid iterations.

- **Decentralized Data Management**  
  Each service manages its own database or data store, promoting autonomy and avoiding shared database bottlenecks.

- **Built for Failure**  
  Microservices embrace the reality of failure. They use patterns like circuit breakers and retries to build fault-tolerant systems.

- **Infrastructure Automation**  
  Continuous integration, automated testing, and deployment pipelines are essential to manage the complexity of microservices.

### 3. Docker Containers - Technical Overview

Docker containers are lightweight, standalone, and executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and configuration. Containers are isolated from one another and from the host system, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across environments.

### Key Characteristics

- **Isolation**: Each container runs in its own isolated environment, providing security and stability.
- **Portability**: Containers encapsulate both the application and its dependencies, allowing them to run consistently across different platforms and environments.
- **Efficiency**: Containers share the host operating system kernel, making them more lightweight and faster to start compared to virtual machines.
- **Ephemerality**: Containers can be quickly created, replicated, stopped, and removed as needed.

### Container vs. Image

- A **Docker image** is a read-only blueprint that defines the contents and configuration of the container, including the application code and runtime environment.
- A **Docker container** is a runtime instance of an image. It can be started, modified, and stopped independently of the original image.

### Container Lifecycle

1. **Build** – Define the image using a `Dockerfile`.
2. **Run** – Start a container from the image using the `docker run` command.
3. **Stop/Restart** – Manage the container's state with commands like `docker stop` and `docker start`.
4. **Remove** – Delete unused containers using `docker rm` to clean up resources.
