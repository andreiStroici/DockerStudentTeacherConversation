## 1. Introduction

This project illustrates a simple communication model between a teacher and multiple students using a microservices architecture. Each component of the system is implemented as an independent microservice and containerized using Docker.

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how Docker can be used to coordinate and manage microservices effectively, showcasing the principles of containerization, isolation, and service orchestration.
